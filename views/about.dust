            <p class="card-text">In our terms, the objective of any good recipe is continuity â€“ clear enough direction
              for anyone to recreate the same dish, no matter who or where they are, with identical
              results.<br>Futhermore, It is meant to include the technical aspects of a dish while also teaching the
              artistic combination of flavor and texture. A recipe communicates the ingredients and procedures the chef
              uses to make his creations</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">History</h2>
            <p class="card-text">King Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called Forme of Cury in 1390, and
              around the same time, another book was published entitled Curye on Inglish, "cury" meaning cooking.Both
              books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served in England at that
              time. The luxurious taste of the aristocracy in the Early Modern Period brought with it the start of what
              can be called the modern recipe book. </p>
